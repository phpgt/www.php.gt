	<h1>Help! I just need somebody!</h1>
	<p>Help, not just anybody</p>
	<p>Help, you know I need someone, help</p>
	<p>When I was younger, so much younger than today</p>
	<p>I never needed anybody's help in any way</p>
	<p>But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured</p>
	<p>Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors</p>
