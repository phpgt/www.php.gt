The www.php.gt website.
=======================

This repository holds the source code for the PHP.GT website and documentation, and itself is a WebEngine application.

This README acts as a guide to understanding how the website is put together and how it takes advantage of some interesting PHP.GT functionality, including:

- Routing pages vs. APIs
- Managing content from a third-party source
- Using dynamic paths
- Managing project secrets and config variables

## Installation

// TODO: Getting started to make changes locally.

## Project outline

// TODO: Describe directory layout and what each thing does. 

// TODO: Content managed on individual Github wikis.

## Routing pages vs. APIs

// TODO: Most requests will be pages via a web browser, but APIs can be handled too.

// TODO: Github webhook to know when there's a change to the content in one of the wikis.

## Managing content from a third-party source

// TODO: The best content management system is the one you already use.

// TODO: Github wikis are where the original documentation is stored.

## Using dynamic paths

// TODO: Can't have an individual page for each repo and each page within the repo's wiki.

// TODO: Dynamic pages and routing with the `@` character

## Managing project secrets and config variables

// TODO: Github webhook could be forged by anyone - how should this be protected?

// TODO: Deploying to a server.
